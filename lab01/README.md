Problem 1 - startsWithY
In the existing App class, design the predicate startsWithY that determines if the supplied string starts with the letter "y" (either upper or lowercase). Write at least 3 tests.

Problem 2 - bingoWord
For any word of at least one character that starts with a letter, let's say that its "bingo word" is the uppercase version of the first letter, followed by a space, and then followed by the number of characters in the word.

For example, the bingo word of "bingo" is "B 5" and the bingo word of "Win" is "W 3".

In the existing App class, write the function bingoWord that takes a string as an argument and returns its bingo word. You may assume that the argument is a valid word as described above.
Reminder: given a string s, s.toUpperCase() converts it to caps and s.charAt(0) gets the letter at the first index.
Write at least 2 tests.
